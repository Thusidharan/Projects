# Azure Networking and Security Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure network architecture in Azure. The setup includes Virtual Networks (VNet), Azure Firewall, Bastion, a Virtual Machine (VM), and an Nginx web application. The goal is to securely access the VM via the Bastion host and route external traffic through the Azure Firewall.

## Architecture Design

The architecture involves setting up a VNet containing multiple subnets. A VM is hosted in the default subnet and secured with Azure Firewall and Bastion host. The firewall manages incoming traffic, while the Bastion host provides secure access to the VM without exposing it to public networks. A DNAT rule is configured on the firewall to route external traffic to the Nginx web server running on the VM.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Resource Group, Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnets Setup
- Created a resource group for managing all Azure resources.
- Set up a Virtual Network (VNet) with multiple subnets:
  - Azure Bastion Subnet for Bastion host access.
  - Azure Firewall Subnet for firewall operations.
  - Default Subnet for hosting the VM and web app.
  - Firewall Manager Subnet (auto-created) for managing firewall rules.

### 2. Provisioning Virtual Machine (VM) in Default Subnet
- Deployed a VM within the Default Subnet, restricting access by assigning a private IP and disabling public IP access.
- Enabled SSH and created a new key pair for secure access.
- Accessed the VM using Azure Bastion, ensuring secure encrypted communication through a private IP.
  
### 3. Installing Nginx on VM
- Installed **Nginx** on the provisioned VM.
- Configured Nginx to host a simple HTML web page.

### 4. Configuring Azure Firewall with DNAT Rules
- Configured Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) rules in Azure Firewall.
- Created a rule to route external traffic:
    - Source: My IP address (restricted access for demonstration).
    - Destination: Public IP of the firewall.
    - Destination Port: 4000.
    - Translated IP: VM's private IP.
    - Translated Port: 80 (Nginx running port).
    
- External traffic from a public IP on port **4000** was routed to the VM's **private IP** on port **80** (default Nginx port).
  
### 5. Verifying the Setup
- Verified the setup by accessing the Nginx-hosted web page using the firewall's public IP and port 4000.
- Ensured the DNAT rule securely directed traffic to the VM, protecting it from direct public exposure.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Virtual Network (VNet)**: Network resource management.
- **Azure Firewall**: Securing and managing traffic.
- **Azure Bastion**: Secure VM access.
- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: Hosting the Nginx web server.
- **Nginx Web Server**: Serving a simple web page.
- **Resource Groups (SG)**: Managing the resources.
- **DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation)**: Controlling traffic routing.

## Summary

This project showcases the implementation of a secure Azure network architecture with external traffic management and secure access to a virtual machine. By leveraging Azure VNet, Firewall, and Bastion, traffic flow was securely controlled and access restricted. The DNAT rules successfully routed external requests to the Nginx server, demonstrating a strong understanding of Azure's networking and security tools.
